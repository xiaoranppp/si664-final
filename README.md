# Marvel World

## Purpose
 We found this data on kaggle which expands the statistic(including height, weight and so on) data and super powers of super heros from the marvel world. Also this data set has the information of the comics in which every super heros comes from. Based on this data set we would like to achieve a web based database with following deployment and functions:

 1, Display the information, stats and super powers of each hero and the comics where these heros appeared. Display comics information. 

 2, Achieved search function: search hero and return all information related to this hero; search comic and return all information related to this comic; search a propoerty(including super power) and return all the heros have this property.( as it is displayed in 3); Search 2 heros and return all the comics and all the same property of these 2 heros.

 3, If I having more time, I will do comic recommendation(based on heros appears in these comics and some complex recommondation algorithm).
